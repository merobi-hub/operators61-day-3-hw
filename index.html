            <p>Of things some are in our power, and others are not. In our power are 
                opinion (ὑπόληψις), movement toward a thing (ὁρμή), desire, aversion 
                (ἔκκλισις, turning from a thing); and in a word, whatever are our own 
                acts: not in our power are the body, property, reputation, offices 
                (magisterial power), and in a word, what­ever are not our own acts. And 
                the things in our power are by nature free, not subject to restraint nor 
                hindrance: but the things not in our power are weak, slavish, subject to 
                restraint, in the power of others. Remember then that if you think the 
                things which are by nature slavish to be free, and the things which are in 
                the power of others to be your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you 
                will be disturbed, you will blame both gods and men: but if you think that only 
                which is your own to be your own, and if you think that what is another's, as it 
                really is, belongs to another, no man will ever compel you, no man will hinder 
                you, you will never blame any man, you will accuse no man, you will do nothing 
                involuntarily (against your will), no man will harm you, you will have no enemy, 
                for you will not suffer any harm.</p> 
            <p>If then you desire (aim at) such great things, 
                remember that you must not (attempt to) lay hold of them with a small effort; but 
                you must leave alone some things entirely, and postpone others for the present. 
                But if you wish for these things also (such great things), and power (office) and 
                wealth, perhaps you will not gain even these very things (power and wealth) because 
                you aim also at those former things (such great things):[2] certainly you will fail 
                in those things through which alone happiness and freedom are secured. Straightway, 
                then, practice saying to every harsh appearance,[3] You are an appearance, and in no 
                manner what you appear to be. Then examine it by the rules which you possess, and by 
                this first and chiefly, whether it relates to the things which are in our power or to 
                the things which are not in our power: and if it relates to anything which is not in 
                our power, be ready to say, that it does not con­cern you. </p>

                Remember that desire contains in it the profession (hope) of obtaining 
                that which you desire; and the profession (hope) in aversion (turning 
                from a thing) is that you will not fall into that which you attempt to 
                avoid: and he who fails in his desire is unfortunate; and he who falls 
                into that which he would avoid, is unhappy. If then you attempt to avoid 
                only the things contrary to nature which are within your power, you will 
                not be involved in any of the things which you would avoid. But if you 
                attempt to avoid disease or death or poverty, you will be unhappy. Take 
                away, then, aversion from all things which are not in our power, and 
                transfer it to the things contrary to nature which are in our power. But 
                destroy desire completely for the present. For if you desire anything which 
                is not in our power, you must be unfortunate: but of the things in our power,
                 and which it would be good to desire, nothing yet is before you. But employ 
                 only the power of moving toward an object and retiring from it; and these 
                 powers indeed only slightly and with exceptions and with remission.[4]
